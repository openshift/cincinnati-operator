    kubernetes.io/description: This Service exposes a client-agnostic update graph
      to other clients within the cluster. This allows convenient in-cluster access
      to those graphs, and also allows platform monitoring to scrape graph-builder
      containers for Prometheus metrics. See https://github.com/openshift/cincinnati/blob/master/docs/design/cincinnati.md#graph-builder
